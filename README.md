# VS Code to Visual Studio Shortcuts Cheat Sheet

I'm a long-time VS Code user and love it for its lightweight design, powerful extensions, and overall ease of use. It's been my go-to editor for years.

However, recently I had to start using Visual Studio as well due to some project requirements. As a result, I found myself needing a shortcut cheat sheet to ease the transition from VS Code to Visual Studio.

So, I made this! If you're like meâ€”whether you're forced to use Visual Studio or just starting to explore itâ€”this cheat sheet might come in handy. ðŸ˜‰
